## User Stories


The following **required** functionality is completed:

1. [X]  Required: Milestone 0 - To the Cloud!
2. [X]  Required: Milestone 1 - Create MHN Admin VM
3. [X]  Required: Milestone 2 - Install the MHN Admin Application
4. [X]  Required: Milestone 3 - Create a MHN Honeypot VM
5. [X]  Required: Milestone 4 - Install the Honeypot Application
6. [X]  Required: Milestone 5 - Attack!

Honeypots deployed: I deployed three different honeypots. The first one I did was Dionaea which had the most attacks right away.
Then I deployed Cowrie and Snort, and those both had low attack numbers. But they were still able to find some honeypots around 
the world. 

Issues: The only issue that occured was setting up the VMs for the different honeypots and admin, but once that 
was finished everything else went smoothly. 

Summary: There was about 2,000 attacks that was found through out the three honeypots that were deployed. The most attacks came
from Dionaea. Then snort and Cowrie didn't even come close to the amount that Dionaea found, but Snort had the second most attacks. 

## Video Walkthrough
